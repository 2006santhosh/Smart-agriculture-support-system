# Smart Crop Advisory System

## Project Overview

The Smart Crop Advisory System is a web-based application developed to help small and marginal farmers select suitable crops based on soil conditions, weather data, and seasonal factors. The system uses machine learning and real-time information to provide accurate and practical crop recommendations.

The main objective of this project is to simplify the decision-making process for farmers and reduce crop-related losses by using modern technology.
